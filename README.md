# Projects:


<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/poojaparab/poojaparab/blob/dev_1/uberlyft.webp">**[Uber and Lyft Fare Prediction Model](https://github.com/poojaparab/UBER-and-Lyft-Fare-Prediction-Model)**

**Objective**: Created fare price prediction model for ride hailing companies Uber and Lyft in the greater Boston area. 

**Implementation**: Used Linear regression with closed form solution and stocastic gradient descent. Explored the impact of regularization by trying Ridge, Lasso, Elastic-Net, penalty term and hyperparameters like batch size and learning rate. Developed the same in polynomial regression.

<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/poojaparab/poojaparab/blob/dev_1/absa.png">**[Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/poojaparab/Aspect-Based-Sentiment-Analysis)**

**Objective**: Extracting the aspect, opinion about the aspect and polarity of the opinion word.

**Implementation**: Using Corefernce Resolution (with nerualcoref library), Stanza (previously standfordcore NLP) , textblob and fundamental grammer rules extracted aspect, opinion and polarity. Built a custom docker container, deployed it on AWS Sagemaker, and tested the robustness of the algorithm with the yelp dataset.

<img align="left" width="250" height="200" src="https://github.com/poojaparab/poojaparab/blob/dev_1/spotify-logo-1920x1080.jpg">**[Spotify Hit Songs Predictor](https://github.com/poojaparab/Spotify-hit-song-predictor)**

**Objective**: To predict the spotify songs from 1960s-2010s will be hit or miss.

**Implementation**: Used Multinomial Logistic Regression, Support vector Machine, Random forest Classifier. Tried optimization of hyperparameters to maximize the performance. Implemented ensemble learning on individual outperforming classifiers.

<img align="left" width="220" height="200" src="https://github.com/poojaparab/poojaparab/blob/dev_1/olist_.png">**[Price Optimization of E-commerce Platform](https://github.com/poojaparab/Price-Optimization-of-E-commerce-platform)**

**Objective**: Attempted to predict the best best optimal price of the product yet increase their profit margin using data mining techniques, Regression models (Linear Ridge, Lasso) and demad curve.

**Implementation**: Used linear regression, principal component analysis. Plotted a demand curve by using profit and demand functions to get the optimal price of the product.

# Mirco-Projects

- **[Network Analysis of Game of Thrones](https://github.com/poojaparab/Network-Analysis-of-Game-of-Thrones)** : Performed co-occurrence network analysis of the characters in the 5 Game of Thrones books. Obtained a well-known character using degree of centrality, betweeness centrality and pegerank algorithm.

- **[Predicting credit card approvals](https://github.com/poojaparab/predicting-credit-card-approvals)**: Performed Logistic regression on UCI credit card approval dataset. Additionally, performed gridsearchCV to find best performing model.


- **[All the Data Mining course homework](https://github.com/poojaparab/Data-mining-homeworks)** : Learned and Implemented PCA, Pagerank, Apriori, ANN, CNN and decision tree algorithms.

- **[Scala's real world project repository data exploration](https://github.com/poojaparab/Scala-Real-world-Project-repository-Data-exploration)**: Performed Exploratory Data analysis on the dataset of real world project repository of Scala that spans data from a version control system (Git) as well as a project hosting site (GitHub).
